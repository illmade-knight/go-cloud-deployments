### Verifying dataflow with e2e test

We have a dataflow that chains services.

we'll show the end to end tests - these are in the repo github.com/illmade-knight/go-cloud-deployments

these use services defined in github.com/illmade-knight/go-dataflow-services

and these service rely on a pkg library in github.com/illmade-knight/go-dataflow

Give an evaluation of the files as I present them

We'll start with github.com/illmade-knight/go-dataflow

We want to ensure we never double wrap messages in the pipeline

What do I mean by double wrapping? We have a base message type and MessageData holds Payload - 
we want to ensure this Payload field never contains a raw []byte MessageData

````
type Message struct {
	// MessageData contains the core payload and user-defined enrichment data.
	MessageData

	// Attributes holds metadata from the message broker (e.g., Pub/Sub attributes, MQTT topic).
	Attributes map[string]string

	// Ack is a function to call to signal that processing was successful and the
	// message can be permanently removed from the source.
	Ack func()

	// Nack is a function to call to signal that processing has failed and the
	// message should be re-queued or sent to a dead-letter queue.
	Nack func()
}

// MessageData holds the essential payload of a message. This struct is often
// serialized and used as the data for messages being published to a downstream system.
type MessageData struct {
	// ID is the unique identifier for the message from the source broker.
	ID string `json:"id"`

	// Payload is the raw byte content of the message.
	Payload []byte `json:"payload"`

	// PublishTime is the timestamp when the message was originally published.
	PublishTime time.Time `json:"publishTime"`

	// EnrichmentData is a generic map to hold any kind of data added by
	// pipeline transformers. This data is serialized along with the rest of
	// the MessageData when published.
	EnrichmentData map[string]interface{} `json:"enrichmentData,omitempty"`
}

can you alert as soon as you see an instance of double wrapping

while we go through the files can you ensure we remove any development comments and instead get the files
ready for publishing to github with useful comments and usage information.

look out for any inconsistencies in func calls or structs - we're looking to make the definition and usage as uniform as possible

as we run through this refactor can you keep a list of refactored files and keep track of any files that will be affected by the refactor
show this list at the end of each response.

I'll start with the messagepipeline pkg
